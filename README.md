WCFexample
==========

I completed this project using a tutorial. To demonstrate understanding of some of the concepts involved, this readme will contain some of the concepts I learned while building this project. 

WCF stands for "Windows Communication Foundation" WCF Services are like Web Services, but web services can only communication over HTTP protocol with XML. WCF can communication over more types of protocols: HTTP, TCP, IPC, and MSMQ. This allows the service to communicate with web applications written in different languages, such as a Java application communicating with a .NET application. The clients can use different protocols and message formats, such as one using XML and the other using binary. 

The first commit includes a simple service which concatenates two strings. I will be working to update this to a more elegant example as I continue the tutorial.
